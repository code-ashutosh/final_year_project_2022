### About our project: 

<ul>
<li>With the growth of social networks, an increasing number of people want to find, share, and exchange information with each other without any regard to the geographical distance.</li>

<li>Every second, on average, around 6,000 tweets are tweeted on Twitter, 500 million tweets per day and around 200 billion tweets per year. [source]
<li>Our main objective is to analyse this raw data and extract some useful information.
<li>This analysis can provide online advice and recommendations for both customers and merchants. 
<li>For merchants it provides accurate data for targeting interested audience
<li> Due to the virtual nature of online shopping, users are not easily able to determine whether a product is of good quality, here it can help consumers
